# COSC6364-Adv-Numerical-Analysis
Project: 2D Data Frequency and Convolutional Analysis
Developed By: Mohammad Imtiaz Nur; Fettah Kiran

- Performed Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT) on 2D images generated by Phantom Generator
- Analysed the FFT2D imgaes in real-imaginary parts, magnitude, phase, energy spectrum
- Implemented high-low band pass filters, butterworth high-low pass filters 
- Gaussian 2D filter along with x-axis, y-axis individually
- Rectangular 2D filter along with x-axis, y-axis individually
- hamming, hanning filters


Run the **ANA_Project_GUI.mlapp** file in Matlab to use the application.
